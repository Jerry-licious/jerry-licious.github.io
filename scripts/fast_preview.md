# WeBWorK Fast Preview UserScript

This is a UserScript made for WeBWorK that allows a slightly faster preview experience without reloading and scrolling by sending requests to the WeBWorK server, loading the equations, and rendering them on the spot rather than reloading the page.



### Installation

To install the UserScript, you need to install an *extension* that hosts them. I personally recommend that you use *Tampermonkey*. You can install it following the instructions on their [website](https://www.tampermonkey.net/). 

After installing the extension, click [here](https://github.com/Jerry-Licious/jerry-licious.github.io/raw/master/scripts/fast_preview.user.js) to install the script itself, and then click **install**. 

That's it!



### Usage

After you navigate to WeBWorK, you will now see a **Fast Preview** button placed next to the **Preview Answers** button. Clicking the button will show you previews of your work above their text fields shortly.

Please remember that fast preview does **not** make WeBWorK save your work. You have to click **Preview Answers** or **Submit Answers** to make sure that your responses will be recorded.
